Welcome to ClimateSERV's documentation!
=======================================

ClimateSERV is a SERVIR created web-based tool that provides three datasets together in one system to help decision-makers in SERVIRâ€™s data-sparse regions assess the evolving situation via holistic analysis of water and agriculture. Using ClimateSERV, development practitioners, scientists/researchers, and government decision-makers can readily analyze historical rainfall for the past 30 years and compare it with the best available forecasts for the next 180 days for their defined area of interest to improve understanding of, and make improved decisions for, issues related to agriculture and water availability.
